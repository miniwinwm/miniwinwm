 *
 *     Function: getDisplayPoint()
 *
 *  Description: Given a valid set of calibration factors and a point
 *                value reported by the touch screen, this function
 *                calculates and returns the true (or closest to true)
 *                display point below the spot where the touch screen
 *                was touched.
 *
 *
 *
 *  Argument(s): displayPtr (output) - Pointer to the calculated
 *                                      (true) display point.
 *               screenPtr (input) - Pointer to the reported touch
 *                                    screen point.
 *               matrixPtr (input) - Pointer to calibration factors
 *                                    matrix previously calculated
 *                                    from a call to
 *                                    setCalibrationMatrix()
 *
 *
 *  The function simply solves for Xd and Yd by implementing the
 *   computations required by the translation matrix.
 *

 *                                              \-     -/
 *
 *  It must be kept brief to avoid consuming CPU cycles.
 *
 *
 *       Return: OK - the display point was correctly calculated
 *                     and its value is in the output argument.
 *               NOT_OK - an error was detected and the function
 *                         failed to return a valid point.
 *
 *
 *
 *                 NOTE!    NOTE!    NOTE!
 *
 *  setCalibrationMatrix() and getDisplayPoint() will do fine
 *  for you as they are, provided that your digitizer
 *  resolution does not exceed 10 bits (1024 values).  Higher
 *  resolutions may cause the integer operations to overflow
 *  and return incorrect values.  If you wish to use these
 *  functions with digitizer resolutions of 12 bits (4096
 *  values) you will either have to a) use 64-bit signed
 *  integer variables and math, or b) judiciously modify the
 *  operations to scale results by a factor of 2 or even 4.
