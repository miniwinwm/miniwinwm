  Summary:
    Initializes the instance of the I2C peripheral operating in I2C mode.

  Description:
    This function initializes the given instance of the I2C peripheral as
    configured by the user from the MHC.

  Precondition:
    The Generic Clock Generator should have been assigned to the I2Cx
    Peripheral Clock Channel.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
        I2C1_Initialize();
    </code>

  Remarks:
    Stops the I2C if it was already running and reinitializes it.

// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    bool I2C1_Read(uint16_t address, uint8_t *pdata, size_t length)

  Summary:
    Reads data from the slave.

  Description:
    This function reads the data from a slave on the bus. The function will
    attempt to read length number of bytes into pdata buffer from a slave whose
    address is specified as address. The I2C Master generate a Start condition,
    read the data and then generate a Stop Condition.
    If the slave NAKs the request or a bus error is encountered on the bus, the
    transfer is terminated. The application can call I2C1_ErrorGet()
    function to know that cause of the error.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.
    Calling the read function when another function is already in progress will
    cause the function to return false.

    The library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has
    terminated if callback is registered.

  Precondition:
    I2C1_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    I2C instance.

  Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

    data    - pointer to destination data buffer where the received data should
              be stored.

    length  - length of data buffer in number of bytes. Also the number of bytes
              to be read.

  Returns:
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
            initiated.

    false - The request fails,if there was already a transfer in progress when this
            function was called.

  Example:
    <code>
        uint8_t myData [NUM_BYTES];
        uint8_t myData [NUM_BYTES];
        void MyI2CCallback(uintptr_t context)
        {
            // This function will be called when the transfer completes. Note
            // that this functioin executes in the context of the I2C interrupt.
        }

        I2C1_Initialize();
        I2C1_CallbackRegister(MyI2CCallback, NULL);

        if(!I2C1_Read( SLAVE_ADDR, &myData[0], NUM_BYTES ))

/* Function:
    bool I2C1_Write(uint16_t address, uint8_t *pdata, size_t length)

  Summary:
    Writes data to the slave.

  Description:
    This function writes data to a slave on the bus. The function will attempt
    to write length number of bytes from pdata buffer to a slave whose address
    is specified by address. The I2C Master will generate a Start condition,
    write the data and then generate a Stop Condition. If the slave NAKs the request
    or a bus error was encountered on the bus, the transfer is terminated. The
    application can call the I2C1_ErrorGet() function to know that
    cause of the error.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is then completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.
    Calling the write function when another function is already in progress will
    cause the function to return false.

    The library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has
    terminated.

  Precondition:
    I2C1_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    I2C instance.

  Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

    pdata   - pointer to source data buffer that contains the data to be
              transmitted.

    length  - length of data buffer in number of bytes. Also the number of bytes
              to be written.

  Returns:
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
    initiated.

    false - The request fails,if there was already a transfer in progress when this function
            was called. .

/* Function:
    bool I2C1_WriteForced(uint16_t address, uint8_t* pdata, size_t length)

  Summary:
    Writes data to the slave.

  Description:
    Master calls this function to transmit the entire buffer to the slave even
    if the slave ACKs or NACKs the address or any of the data bytes. This is
    typically used for slaves that have to initiate a reset sequence by sending
    a dummy I2C transaction. Since the slave is still in reset, any or all the
    bytes can be NACKed. In the normal operation, if the address or data byte is
    NACKed, then the transmission is aborted and a STOP condition is asserted on
    the bus.

    This function writes data to a slave on the bus. The function will attempt
    to write length number of bytes from pdata buffer to a slave whose address
    is specified by address. The I2C Master will generate a Start condition,
    write the data and then generate a Stop Condition.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is then completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.

    The library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has
    terminated.

  Precondition:
    I2C1_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    I2C instance.

  Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

    pdata   - pointer to source data buffer that contains the data to be
              transmitted.

    length  - length of data buffer in number of bytes. Also the number of bytes
              to be written.

  Returns:
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
    initiated.

    false - The request fails,if there was already a transfer in progress when this function
            was called.

  Example:
    <code>
        uint8_t myData [NUM_BYTES];
        void MyI2CCallback(uintptr_t context)
        {
            // This function will be called when the transfer completes. Note

/* Function:
    bool I2C1_WriteRead(uint16_t address, uint8_t* wdata,
                               size_t wlength, uint8_t* rdata, size_t rlength)

  Summary:
    Write and Read data from Slave.

  Description:
    This function writes data from the wdata to the bus and then reads data from
    the slave and stores the received in the rdata. The function generates a
    Start condition on the bus and will then send wlength number of bytes
    contained in wdata. The function will then insert a Repeated start condition
    and proceeed to read rlength number of bytes from the slave. The received
    bytes are stored in rdata buffer. A Stop condition is generated after the
    last byte has been received.

    If the slave NAKs the request or a bus error was encountered on the bus,
    the transfer is terminated. The application can call I2C1_ErrorGet()
    function to know that cause of the error.

    The function is non-blocking. It initiates bus activity and returns
    immediately. The transfer is then completed in the peripheral interrupt. A
    transfer request cannot be placed when another transfer is in progress.
    Calling this function when another function is already in progress will
    cause the function to return false.

    The library will call the registered callback function when the transfer has
    terminated.

  Precondition:
    I2C1_Initialize must have been called for the associated
    I2C instance.

  Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

    wdata   - pointer to write data buffer

    wlength - write data length in bytes.

    rdata   - pointer to read data buffer.

    rlength - read data length in bytes.

  Returns:
    true  - The request was placed successfully and the bus activity was
    initiated.

    false - The request fails, if there was already a transfer in progress when this
    function was called.

  Example:
    <code>
        uint8_t myTxData [NUM_BYTES] = {'1', '0', ' ', 'B', 'Y', 'T', 'E', 'S'};
        uint8_t myRxData [NUM_BYTES] = {0};

        void MyI2CCallback(uintptr_t context)
        {
            // This function will be called when the transfer completes. Note
            // that this functioin executes in the context of the I2C interrupt.
        }

        {
            // error handling
        }


    </code>

  Remarks:
    Calling this function is not the same as calling the I2C1_Write()
    function and then calling the I2C1_Read() function.
    The I2C1_WriteRead function will insert a Repeated Start
    condition between the Write and the Read stages. The I2C1_Write()
    and the I2C1_Read() function insert a stop condtion after
    the write and the read has completed.

  Summary:
    Returns the Peripheral busy status.

  Description:
    This function ture if the I2C I2C1I2C module is busy with a
    transfer. The application can use the function to check if I2C
    I2C1I2C module is busy before calling any of the data transfer
    functions. The library does not allow a data transfer operation if another
    transfer operation is already in progress.

  Precondition:
